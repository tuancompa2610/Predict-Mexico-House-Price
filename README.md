## About Repository
In this repository I will build a reggresion model to predict housing price in Mexico. In the first colab notebook I will figure out the feature and build a model to predict housing price in one district in Mexico. Finally I will contencate all the dataset I build a complete model to predict housing price in all district of Mexico.

This project was inspired by the lesson I learned in [WQU](https://www.wqu.edu/)

## Installation
This is a Jupyter notebook. Package requirements are included in requirement.txt. This project uses Python 3.9. Run the following command in terminal to install the required packages. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Useage
The notebook includes all the markdowns which explain the process.

## Model using
* Linear Regression [Linear Regression](https://paperswithcode.com/method/linear-regression)
* Ridge []

## Report
| Model | Baseline MAE | Val MAE |
| ----- | ------------ | ------- |
