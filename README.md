## About Repository
In this repository I will use a dataset of 21,000 properties to determine if real estate prices are influenced more by property size or location. Then I build data visualizations, and examine the relationship between two variables using correlation. Finally I will build a Linear Regression model and Ridge Regression to predict apartment prices in Mexico. Additionally, I also create a data pipeline to impute missing values and encode categorical features, and they improve model performance by reducing overfitting
This project was inspired by the lesson I learned in [WQU](https://www.wqu.edu/)

## Installation
This is a Jupyter notebook. Package requirements are included in requirement.txt. This project uses Python 3.9. Run the following command in terminal to install the required packages. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Useage
The notebook includes all the markdowns which explain the process.
